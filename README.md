# Valorant Farmer (Not Functional Anymore) #
A simple program to automatically farm valorant points. I've tested multiple times and infact unlocked all my agents despite my busy schedule using this program. 
Since it was useful to me, I believe it will also be useful to you and you can do other things while the bot does it's thing.
